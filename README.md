# week3-quiz

This project is a timed quiz.

The acceptance criteria for the project were:
    "GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
    WHEN I click the start button
    THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
    WHEN I answer a question
    THEN I am presented with another question
    WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
    THEN time is subtracted from the clock
    WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
    THEN the game is over
    WHEN the game is over
    THEN I can save my initials and my score"

I believe that my project meets all the acceptance criteria, as well as being deployed appropriately and easy to navigate. I learned a lot more about how to interact with and manipulate the page with Javascript during this project. I successfully employed eventListeners/onclicks, objects, and arrays, as well as a couple for loops.

Future development goals for this project include:
    - randomize order of questions
    - randomize order of answers
    - add text on answer selection notifying them immediately if they are right or wrong
